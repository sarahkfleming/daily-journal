Apparently, your .gitignore file has to be set from the very beginning because once it's tracked, you can't ignore it. Jenna saved us from a lot of stress and frustration trying to fix it. Now I know never to try that again! Right after we resolved that, I met my two little siblings in Cohort 35, Lisa and Gradi. They asked for advice about starting JavaScript, which feels like forever ago! I want to make sure that I'm there for them, so I'm going to keep up with them on Slack. We went back to our projects at around 2:30 pm, and my group divied up modules. I'm in charge of Events.
